# PrivacyAPI
An API that can be used to quickly obtain all the user's open VCC's from privacy.com

# How to Implement
As of now, this is not an npm module since one already exists (using the real privacy.com API), so this acts as a way to implement better functionality for the same thing in your project. In order to use it, just copy login.js and getCards.js. In app.js, you can see that there is a call to the function getCards() from getCards.js, and it takes in your email and password as arguments. Put in your credentials and you're good.
